# Money Distribution Helper

One day i came across a problem of my friend .

There are x room mates and they will bring food items on a specific day
and they will do it in cycle .

The problem is each don't spend the same amount , one might end up spending more
and one might endup spending less .

so what this program does is , it helps in money distribution by giving amount to 
the one who spent more , by taking money from those who spent less.

it gives the ability to add , remove roommates.

says specifically , from which user we should collect and to which user you should give money.

it uses file to store usernames
